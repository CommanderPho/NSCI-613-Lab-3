%\slntParagraph{ It can be observed that thicker myelin sheaths result in a lower capacitance. In the simulation we are only able to adjust the Myelin capacitance parameter, and so we must use this to investigate the effects of sheath thickness on conduction velocity indirectly. We find that increased myelin capacitance has little effect on conduction velocity until a sharp turning point, after which it appears to increase conductance velocity exponentially. Interestingly for values of $0.08 \rfrac{\mu F}{cm^{2}}$ or higher the action potentials are actually abolished entirely. This can be explained by looking a plot of approximate Myelin Sheath thickness ($z$), computed as $z = \frac{1}{x}$ where $x$ is the capacitance value. This is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:P2b2}, and reveals a clear explanation of the phenomenon. There is a point of clearly diminishing returns on increasing the Myelin Sheath Thickness. In terms of the physiological burdens of thicker never fibers and larger Schwann cells, it must first be considered that faster conduction velocity is not always strictly better. For cells to effectively work together to perform complex and coordinated computations, it seems that it's often more important to be predictable and reliable than to simply maximize throughput or conduction velocity. I suspect that there are many systems in the nervous systems that would fail to work appropriately if the conduction velocity was increased only for a portion, and if the system cannot perform as well this can't be said to improve performance. }

%\sln{K = 870}




\slntParagraph{ It can be observed (see Figure \ref{fig:P2}) that thicker myelin sheaths result in a higher conductance velocity. Within the specified number of wraps, there is a monotonically increasing conduction velocity as the number of wraps increases, although diminishing returns is observed as we approach $300$ wraps. In terms of the physiological burdens of thicker never fibers and larger Schwann cells, there's a hard and obvious limit in that the increased thickness of myelin sheaths cannot exceed that which is practical in terms of organism volume. It must also be considered that faster conduction velocity is not always strictly better. For cells to effectively work together to perform complex and coordinated computations, it seems that it's often more important to be predictable and reliable than to simply maximize throughput or conduction velocity.

Within each subplot earlier curves are represented by cooler colors, while later ones are hotter. The $0.036 \rfrac{S}{cm^{2}}$ (top) subplot reveals an AP that hits the interface where a small hump is transmitted, which then slowly dissipates before it can become a full AP. The $0.03567 \rfrac{S}{cm^{2}}$ (middle) plot on the other hand has approximately the same dynamics for the incoming wave and a similar small hump is transmitted, but instead of dissipating it slowly grows into an AP which propagates through the bare axon. The last subplot, $0.001 \rfrac{S}{cm^{2}}$ (bottom), has notably different dynamics despite the same incoming waveform. At the interface, a large and wide peak rapidly grows, which is successfully transmitted down the bare axon.}

\slntParagraph{ As K+ Channel Density is reduced from a value of $0.036 \rfrac{S}{cm^{2}}$, the propagating wave loses less and less energy at the interface between the myelinated and bare portions of the axon.

\caption{\label{fig:P4d2} Partial Demyelination of the axon with a Myelin[0] capacitance (as a stand-in for sheath thickness) of $0.0001 \rfrac{\mu F}{cm^{2}}$ demonstrates the effect of further reduction of Myelin[0] capacitance on AP propagation dynamics. A substantial "reflection" is observed at the interface, with some of the energy propagating backwards back towards the stimulation point.}

\slntParagraph{Finally, the thickness of the myelin sheath in Myelin[0] was modulated by changing the capacitance for that segment. As the capacitance was reduced from its default value of $0.005 \rfrac{\mu F}{cm^{2}}$, it was found that the AP can begin to cross the interface around $0.002 \rfrac{\mu F}{cm^{2}}$ as shown in Figure $\ref{fig:P4d1}$. It was observed that further decreasing the capacitance caused a substantial "bounce back" of the propagating wave (reflection). It appeared as if the amount of energy transmitted through the interface was limited to around the value that caused the AP, while any excess was reflected backwards. This is demonstrated in Figure $\ref{fig:P4d2}$, where a substantial reflection occurs for capacitance values of $0.0001 \rfrac{\mu F}{cm^{2}}$. }
